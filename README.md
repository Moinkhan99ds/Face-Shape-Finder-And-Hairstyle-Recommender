# Face-Shape-Finder-And-Hairstyle-Recommender
A machine learning project that detects face shape using CNN and recommends the best hairstyle using Random Forest and Catboost model
# Face Shape & Hairstyle Recommendation System

This project detects a user's face shape using a CNN model and then recommends the best matching hairstyle using a Random Forest classifier and Catboost

# Project Overview
1. Face Shape Detection (CNN)  
   - Input: User uploads a face image  
   - Output: Model predicts face shape (oval, round, square, etc.)

2. Hairstyle Recommendation   
   - Inputs: Gender, Hair Length, Hair Texture, and Detected Face Shape by CNN
   - Output: Recommended hairstyle name

##  Technologies Used
- Python  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- OpenCV  
- Scikit-learn  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Google Colab

## Model Files
- face_shape_cnn_model.h5 → CNN model for face shape detection   
- hairstyle_model.pkl → Random Forest model for hairstyle recommendation  

---

##  How to Run
1. Open in Google Colab
2. Upload the 2 model files
3. Run the notebook and upload your face image
4. Enter gender, hair texture, and hair length  
    Model will print your face shape and recommended hairstyle
